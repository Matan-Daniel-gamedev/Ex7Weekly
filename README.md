# Explanation
In this project I changed the game from the lesson.
I made the option of taking a ship for swimming, taking a goat for climbing on mountains and taking a pickaxe for carving the mountains and make them become grass.

In addition, I made the game so you can't see tiles if between those tiles and the tile that the player is on there's a mountain tile.

Extra: dying when an enemy collided with the player
